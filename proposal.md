## Abstract

*PhillyGoAnywhereMaskON* 

What features are necessary for a map/navigation app to enhance user experience? Different users and application scenarios may generate a variety of demand for interactive elements in the app. Based on our experience and experimenting with existing map/navigation apps and open source platforms, we decided to build an app that features covid-19 risk assessment, amenities search, 3-in-1 (driving, cycling, and walking) navigation with map, routes, and detailed instructions.
Apart from the user typing input and clickable input features, we also would like to include interactive points of interest inside the navigation map to provide more information and fast-response navigation to faciliate the path finding process. The current functions only include Philadelphia-based local information (zip code, covid tests). We intended to upgrade it with cloud-hosted databased of zip code and covid test results for broader usage at national level.

## Data Sources
