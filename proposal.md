# Final Project Proposal

MUSA 509: Geospatial Cloud Computing & Visualization

**Team Members:** Haoheng Tang, Zhijie Zhou 

## Abstract

*U.S.GoAnywhereMaskON* 

The main idea of this project is to provide users with a COVID-19 special version of "Google Map" OR "Mapbox," with two essential functions:
- one-click COVID-19 Information available at national, state, county levels - note that the zip code level info. is only for Philadelphia city (as a miniature).
- navigation in multiple transportation modes with list of amenities close to user's input destination location.

We would to have the user acknowledge the risk of traveling to a specific place prior to a journey. 

**Primary version**:
  - user-interactive covid-19 test results at multiple scales (pop-up window when clicking on a point on the map, zoom when clicking, etc.)
  - an app that features covid-19 risk assessment, amenities search, 3-in-1 (driving, cycling, and walking) navigation with map, routes, and detailed instructions (for Philadelphia city only).
  
**Advanced version** (if applicable, depending on actual progress):
  - extend the coverage of the navigation map to larger regions, as well as interactive points of interest inside the navigation map to provide more information and fast-response navigation to faciliate the path finding process.
